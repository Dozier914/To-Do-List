# To-Do-List Using JavaScript
With this To-Do List I use glyphicons which are attached to functions. You can type a to-do list item into the search box and 
press the '+' button to add the item. Also the enter key has been set to enter the item as well.

We can also click the trash icon to remove an item from the list. 

The items in the list are stored through a JSON file, properly parsed, so when the app is closed and opened again the items 
remain available. 

Thank you for checking this out and contact me if you would like to suggest 
improvements.
